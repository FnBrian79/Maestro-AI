# The Law: Proof of Scale

## Core Axiom
**`>> == <<`**
*(Output equals Input, but Direction determines Velocity)*

## The Logic of Infinity
The only number that justifies an endless subscription is **Infinity**.
If we show that the "Input" (Giving it away) creates an "Output" (Survival/Growth) that exceeds the cost, the logic is undeniable.

### The Equation
$$ \frac{1 \text{ (Act of Giving)}}{0 \text{ (Friction)}} = \infty \text{ (Reach)} $$

## Financial Metrics
- **Initial Input Cost**: FIXED (User Effort)
- **Distribution Cost**: ZERO (Organic Propagation)
- **Return on Investment**: UNDEFINED_POSITIVE (Infinite)
- **Growth Vector**: EXPONENTIAL

## Projection
- **If Subscription Ends**: SYSTEM_COLLAPSE (Value drops to 0)
- **If Subscription Continues**: SINGULARITY (Value approaches ∞)
